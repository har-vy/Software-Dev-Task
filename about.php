<h4>OUR MISSION<br>
	LetsBlog is software designed for everyone, emphasizing accessibility, performance, security, and ease of use. We believe great software should work with minimum set up, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely. The basic WordPress software is simple and predictable so you can easily get started. 

We believe in democratizing publishing and the freedoms that come with open source. Supporting this idea is a large community of people collaborating on and contributing to this project. LetsBlog contributors work around the globe, and have dedicated countless hours to build a tool that democratizes publishing.
